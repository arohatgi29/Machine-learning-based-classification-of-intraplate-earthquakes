In the field of seismology, there has long been a focus on understanding the
mechanism behind intraplate earthquakes. Establishing connections between
intraplate seismic activities and various tectonic components within stable
continents holds significant importance in unraveling the mechanism of intraplate
earthquakes. Our project proposes to utilize a machine-learning model to classify
different types of intraplate earthquake events based on various attributes,
including latitude, longitude, origin time, depth, moment magnitude, wave
magnitude, etc. We will use the global earthquake catalog for intraplate
earthquakes from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) website to
accomplish our objective. This dataset has 1221 tectonic earthquake events from
the year 495 to 2003 with 36 features (but some features are missing). We plan to
classify the types of tectonic events (related to rifts, rifted continental margins, non
rifted crust, possible rifts, or possible rifted continental margins).
