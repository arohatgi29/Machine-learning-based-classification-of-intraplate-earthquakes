Problem Statement:
In the field of seismology, there has long been a focus on understanding the
mechanism behind intraplate earthquakes. Establishing connections between
intraplate seismic activities and various tectonic components within stable
continents holds significant importance in unraveling the mechanism of intraplate
earthquakes. Our project proposes to utilize a machine-learning model to classify
different types of intraplate earthquake events based on various attributes,
including latitude, longitude, origin time, depth, moment magnitude, wave
magnitude, etc. We will use the global earthquake catalog for intraplate
earthquakes from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) website to
accomplish our objective. This dataset has 1221 tectonic earthquake events from
the year 495 to 2003 with 36 features (but some features are missing). We plan to
classify the types of tectonic events (related to rifts, rifted continental margins, non
rifted crust, possible rifts, or possible rifted continental margins).


Methodology:
Initial and essential part of the project is preprocessing the data to handle the
missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. To achieve the classification problem,
we propose to explore various algorithms, such as decision trees, random forests,
and support vector machines to identify the most suitable model. This will help us
to identify the effective model that can recognize the types of intraplate earthquake
events based on their attributes. For labeling and classification, we will classify the
tectonic events into categories such as rifts, rifted continental margins, non rifted
crust, possible rifts, and possible rifted continental margins. Moreover, we propose
to train the selected machine learning models and evaluate their performance using
appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.


Conclusion:
The machine learning model created in this project is designed to classify different
types of intraplate earthquake events. Its primary purpose is to discern events
related to rifts, rifted continental margins, and non rifted crust. Furthermore, this
model should have the potential to contribute to seismic hazard evaluation, risk
reduction efforts, and scientific investigations within stable continental regions.
